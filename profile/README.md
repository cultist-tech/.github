### Introduction

Our global goal as a P2E project is to create a unique gaming product, a sustainable economy, a dedicated gaming community, as well as to create and develop tools for attracting web 2.0 players to the blockchain and NEAR directly.
We also have a goal as developers for the NEAR community â€” to develop opensource universal tools for game development and simplify the transfer of existing projects to the blockchain.
We offer a comprehensive solution to the problems for the target group - browser games on ThreeJS with the ability to adapt to mobile devices.
